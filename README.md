# Nyctermoon AtlasLoot - WoW Vanilla (1.12.1) AddOn

Get the latest version here: https://github.com/liminalwarmth/AtlasLoot/releases/

A customized version of the classic World of Warcraft AtlasLoot addon with custom loot for the Nyctermoon private server added. In this version, tables have been added for custom Nyctermoon consumables, eternal items, legendaries, utility items, and more.

This addon was built by members of the Nyctermoon community (original credit to Jacob), and I have updated the tables to work with the latest DB changes as of 9/3/24, re-arranged the table structure, and added new custom items since the last update.
